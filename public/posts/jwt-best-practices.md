## Introduction

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are widely used for authentication in modern web applications. While they're easy to implement, improper usage can lead to serious security vulnerabilities. This guide explains how to securely use JWTs in both interviews and production apps.

---

## What Is a JWT?

A JSON Web Token is a compact way to transmit information between two parties. JWTs are Base64-encoded, not encrypted. This means anyone who gets access to a token can decode its contents and read the data inside.

For this reason, sensitive information such as passwords or private keys should never be included in the payload of a JWT.

---

## Use the Phantom Token Pattern

One effective approach to secure JWTs is the phantom token pattern. Here's how it works:

- The client receives a reference token instead of the real JWT.
- The backend or API gateway uses this reference to retrieve the actual JWT securely.
- This ensures that the real JWT is only used internally and never exposed to the client.

This pattern adds an extra layer of security and control, especially in microservices or API gateway architectures.

---

## Avoid Storing Tokens Insecurely

Storing JWTs in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` is common but dangerous, as these methods are vulnerable to XSS attacks.

A more secure approach is to store tokens in **HTTP-only, Secure cookies** with the `SameSite` flag enabled. This prevents JavaScript access and reduces cross-site vulnerabilities.

---

## Validate Tokens Properly

### 1. Check the Algorithm

Never trust the algorithm specified in the token’s header. Attackers can tamper with the `alg` field to use insecure options like `none`. Always enforce a strict allowlist, such as only accepting `RS256`.

### 2. Validate Claims

Critical claims like `iss` (issuer) and `aud` (audience) must match expected values. This ensures the token comes from a trusted source and is intended for your API.

### 3. Use Short Expiration

Tokens should always have an expiration time (`exp`) to reduce the risk window if a token is leaked. Combine short-lived access tokens with refresh tokens if persistent sessions are needed.

---

## Summary

Implementing JWT securely is essential to avoid common vulnerabilities. Here are the key takeaways:

- Never include sensitive data inside a JWT.
- Use the phantom token pattern to keep real JWTs on the backend.
- Avoid storing tokens in client-accessible storage.
- Always validate the `alg`, `iss`, and `aud` fields.
- Keep token lifetimes short and refresh as needed.

By following these practices, you’ll be prepared to handle JWT securely in interviews and real-world applications.
