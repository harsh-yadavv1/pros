JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a powerful way to handle user authentication. But if not used properly, they can expose your app to major security risks.

Let’s walk through the right way to use JWTs securely — in interviews and in real projects.

---

## What is a JWT?

A JWT is a Base64-encoded token that stores claims (like user ID, issuer, etc.) in a compact form.

It’s not encrypted — anyone can decode it. So never include passwords or secret data inside the token.

---

## Why Security Matters

- A weak JWT setup can lead to data leaks or unauthorized access.
- Many developers misuse JWTs by trusting them blindly or storing them unsafely.

---

## Common Mistakes

- Storing tokens in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`
- Trusting the algorithm (`alg`) sent by the token
- Not checking `iss` (issuer) and `aud` (audience) fields
- Keeping tokens valid for too long

---

## Best Practices

- Store JWTs in **HTTP-only, Secure cookies**
- Accept only trusted algorithms like `RS256`
- Validate critical claims (`iss`, `aud`)
- Set short expiration times (`exp`) and use refresh tokens
- Use the **phantom token pattern** to avoid exposing real tokens

---

## What is Phantom Token Pattern?

- Client receives a reference token
- Backend uses it to fetch the actual JWT
- Real token stays hidden from the user

This approach adds an extra layer of control and security — especially in microservice or API gateway setups.

---

## Final Thoughts

JWTs are useful but must be handled with care. Think of them like passports — easy to carry, but dangerous if forged.

Stick to the best practices, and you’ll be well-prepared for both technical interviews and production-ready security.
